/*
 * Name of the game for this AI script is that the AI is dumb, and is only able to make decisions
 * based off of dice and coin flips. Think your friend who brings dice and coins everywhere,
 * and INSISTS on using them whenever possible, even if it's to their own detriment.
 * 
 * So basically, program me as an AI when I play poker. 
 * 
 * 
 * I am spectacularly bad at poker.
